# High-Cloud-Airlines-Data-Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of airline data, with a specific focus on understanding and optimizing the load factor. By examining key performance indicators and creating detailed visualizations, this project aims to provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and profitability.

## Project Objectives
* Analyze and interpret key performance indicators (KPIs), with a specific focus on the load factor, to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement.
* Develop interactive dashboards and reports to visualize complex data insights.
* Present findings and dashboard iterations to effectively communicate data-driven recommendations.
* Coordinate team efforts, conduct internal meetings, and facilitate clarification sessions to ensure project alignment and successful delivery.

## Tools Used
* **Excel:** Used for data manipulation and creating a dashboard.
* **Power BI:** Utilized for data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **Tableau:** Employed for developing interactive dashboards.
* **SQL:** Used for querying and extracting data.

## Key Findings
Our analysis was based on the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

1.  **Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Load Factor:** Calculated the load factor percentage on different time bases to identify trends.
2.  **Carrier-Based Load Factor:** Found the load factor percentage for each specific airline carrier.
3.  **Top 10 Carrier Names:** Identified the most preferred airlines based on passenger count.
4.  **Top Routes:** Displayed the busiest routes based on the number of flights.
5.  **Load Factor vs. Day of Week:** Identified how the load factor changes on weekends versus weekdays.
6.  **Number of Flights by Distance Group:** Counted the number of flights based on distance categories.
7.  **Route Search:** Used a filter to find flights between specific source and destination locations.
