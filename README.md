# High-Cloud-Airlines-Data-Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of airline data to identify key trends and opportunities for improving business performance. By focusing on critical metrics, particularly the load factor, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can help High Cloud Airlines optimize its operational efficiency, increase profitability, and enhance overall service. The analysis includes a comprehensive examination of customer and flight data to uncover patterns in passenger behavior and flight routes.

## Project Objectives
* Analyze and interpret key performance indicators (KPIs), with a specific focus on the load factor, to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement.
* Develop interactive dashboards and reports to visualize complex data insights.
* Present findings and dashboard iterations to effectively communicate data-driven recommendations.
* Coordinate team efforts, conduct internal meetings, and facilitate clarification sessions to ensure project alignment and successful delivery.

## Tools Used
* **Excel:** Used for data manipulation and creating a dashboard.
* **Power BI:** Utilized for data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **Tableau:** Employed for developing interactive dashboards.
* **SQL:** Used for querying and extracting data.

## Key Findings
Our analysis was based on the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

1.  **Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Load Factor:** Calculated the load factor percentage on different time bases to identify trends.
2.  **Carrier-Based Load Factor:** Found the load factor percentage for each specific airline carrier.
3.  **Top 10 Carrier Names:** Identified the most preferred airlines based on passenger count.
4.  **Top Routes:** Displayed the busiest routes based on the number of flights.
5.  **Load Factor vs. Day of Week:** Identified how the load factor changes on weekends versus weekdays.
6.  **Number of Flights by Distance Group:** Counted the number of flights based on distance categories.
7.  **Route Search:** Used a filter to find flights between specific source and destination locations.
